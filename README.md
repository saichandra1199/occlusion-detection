### To run the face detection model use the following steps.(First of all we gonna be discussing about generating our own face encoding and then move to use already available encoding file.) 
#### 1. Store the Images on which you want to apply face detection in data folder
#### 2. For generating the encoding use the gen_encod.py file using the following commands:
                          $ python gen_encode.py
#### 3. Now tuning some required parameters in the face_vid .py file run it on the generated encoding.
                          $ python face_vid.py
#### 4.You are good to go..
